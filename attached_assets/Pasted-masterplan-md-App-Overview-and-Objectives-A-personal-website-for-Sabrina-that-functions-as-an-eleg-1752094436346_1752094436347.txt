App Overview and Objectives

A personal website for Sabrina that functions as an elegant digital resume. The site will highlight her biography, academic and work experience, contact information, and professional achievements, including extracurriculars and entrepreneurship. It will include modern animations such as collapsible sections to enhance user interaction.

Target Audience
	•	Potential employers
	•	Networking contacts
	•	Academic and professional peers

Core Features and Functionality
	•	Responsive, mobile- and desktop-friendly single-page layout
	•	Bio/Introduction section
	•	Contact information with clickable email and external website link
	•	Profile photo display
	•	Sections for:
	•	Education history
	•	Work experience
	•	LinkedIn (placeholder link)
	•	Extracurriculars or personal highlights
	•	Entrepreneurship initiatives
	•	Elegant animations including:
	•	Smooth scrolling
	•	Collapsible/expandable content areas for each major section

High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations
	•	Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (TailwindCSS or custom styles for elegance), JavaScript (for interactivity)
	•	Animation Library: Optional use of libraries like AOS (Animate On Scroll) or small JavaScript utilities for collapsibles
	•	Deployment Platform: Replit static site or any hosting supporting HTML/CSS/JS

Conceptual Data Model

Since this is a static resume site, structured data could be organized as follows (possibly in JSON or embedded JavaScript objects):
	•	bio: string
	•	contact: { email: string, website: string, linkedin: string (placeholder) }
	•	photo: image placeholder path
	•	education: list of { school, degree, date, description }
	•	experience: list of { company, role, date, description }
	•	extracurriculars: list of strings or structured highlights
	•	entrepreneurship: list of { project name, description }

User Interface Design Principles
	•	Minimal, clean layout with generous whitespace
	•	Elegant fonts and soft color palette
	•	Sections well-separated with subtle visual cues
	•	Mobile-first responsiveness
	•	Intuitive navigation (e.g., section anchors or scroll-based interface)

Security Considerations
	•	Email should be protected from scraping (e.g., obfuscation or form-based contact)
	•	LinkedIn and other links open in new tabs to preserve session

Development Phases or Milestones
	1.	Define and finalize content structure (with placeholders)
	2.	Build HTML/CSS layout and structure
	3.	Add JavaScript-based interactivity (collapsibles, smooth scrolling)
	4.	Optimize responsiveness for different screen sizes
	5.	Deploy to Replit and test functionality
	6.	Replace placeholders with real content when available

Potential Challenges and Solutions
	•	Responsive Design: Use Flexbox/Grid and media queries to ensure compatibility
	•	Performance: Optimize image size and minimal use of heavy libraries
	•	Accessibility: Ensure text contrast, font size, and navigability for all users

Future Expansion Possibilities
	•	Add downloadable resume PDF
	•	Include a contact form
	•	Integrate social media profiles
	•	Add a blog or updates section
	•	Include testimonials or endorsements
